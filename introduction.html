    <p>The purpose of this blog is to keep track of the stuff I learn about Artificial Intelligence and
Machine Learning. While most of the stuff I post may only make sense to my head, I will try to
make them as consistent as possible in the case that someone else reads this. I am still an
undergraduate student, therefore I may post erroneous information. If you find such errors, I would
appreciate that you let me know, as I want to understand this the best I can. Sometimes I may post
code to some other problems that may be unrelated to AI/ML, that just means that I was in the mood
for something else. Learning and applying what I learn is my passion, as someone I believe to be my
friend made me realize. I vehemently search for the truth behind things, and will go as far as my
curiosity may take me.</p>
